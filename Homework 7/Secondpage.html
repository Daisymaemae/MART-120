        <h1 class="title">The Gift of the Rainbow</h1>
       
        <p class="content">In a vibrant village by a river, the people lived in harmony with nature. One day, a young girl named Aiyana noticed that the colors of the rainbow had faded. Worried that the beauty of the world was disappearing, she decided to seek help from the Great Spirit.
        
        <p class="content">Aiyana climbed the highest mountain and called out, “Great Spirit, our colors are fading! Please help us!”
        
        <p class="content">The Great Spirit appeared in a swirl of light and said, “To restore the colors, you must share kindness and love with others.” Aiyana nodded, determined to spread joy.
        
        <p class="content">On her way back, she helped an elder carry firewood, shared her lunch with a hungry child, and comforted a friend in sorrow. Each act of kindness brought back a color of the rainbow.
        
        <p class="content">By the time she reached her village, the sky was filled with vibrant hues again. The villagers rejoiced, realizing that love and kindness were the true gifts of the world. Aiyana smiled, knowing that the colors of the rainbow would shine brightly as long as they continued to care for one another.
